# Web security testing

Test only authorized targets. Keep requests within the granted origin, identity, rate, and scope; obtain approval before expanding them. Open the session with `--capture`, exercise the relevant flow, then work from its message IDs.

`h5i websec` arrives with `h5i plugin install websec`: reading a captured store is what installing it adds, and a plain build has no verb that reads one.

```bash
h5i browser open https://target.example --capture
h5i websec requests --human
h5i websec show req_42 --raw
h5i websec replay req_42 --set query.id=456
h5i websec diff res_42 res_43 --human
h5i websec match res_43 --status 200 --contains ok
h5i websec finding create --title '...' --evidence req_42,res_43
```

`finding` is where a conclusion goes. `create` takes the title, a free-text
`--state`, the message ids it rests on and an optional `--repro` file; `list`,
`show` and `update` read and amend it. h5i refuses evidence this session does
not hold and reads nothing else, so the claim stays yours and the ids stay
checkable.

The starting URL may be an API endpoint rather than an HTML page. For example,
`h5i browser open https://target.example/api/health --capture` is a quick way to
seed an authenticated or unauthenticated capture before doing the rest of the
work with `websec`.

Four things about `replay` that are easier to know than to discover.

**A `json.` value is typed the way it reads.** `json.id=99` is a number,
`json.active=true` a boolean, `json.role=admin` a string. Quote it to insist on
a string: `json.password="0e830400451993494058024219903391"` is the magic hash a
PHP `==` compares equal, and unquoted it is the *number* zero. When the encoded
value differs from the text you typed, the receipt says so in `encoded`.
Dots walk nested objects, and numeric dotted segments address existing array
elements (`json.items.0.name=changed`). Bracket notation such as
`json.items[0].name` is refused; use dotted indices for an existing array or
`--raw-request` when constructing a new array or a complete body.

**Header names go out lower-cased unless you ask otherwise.** That is what every
HTTP client does, and a proxy that looks a header up by exact string does not
care: it finds `Content-Length` and misses `content-length`. `--raw-headers`
sends the request the edits produced with the names written as given — `--set`
still applies, cookies still travel. Reach for `--raw-request` only when the
framing itself is the test, since that one makes you write every byte.

**Walking a list is `--set-each`, not a shell loop.** `--set-each
query.id=./ids.txt` sends once per line and returns one sample per send, each
naming the value that produced it. A loop outside pays process startup per
request and gives back N documents nothing correlates.

**A body that is not text comes out with `--body-to`.** `show --raw` says
`[85 bytes, not text — sha256 …]` rather than mangling a PNG or a git object
through the terminal; `show --body-to PATH` writes the bytes, and `--body-to -`
writes them to standard output for a pipe.

The engine runs a page's own event handlers when `--script` is on: inline `on*`
attributes fire, a subresource that did or did not load fires `load` or `error`
at the element that asked, and `form.submit()` sends a real request. So
`<img src=x onerror=…>` and `<svg onload=…>` behave as payloads rather than as
inert markup, and a POST flow can be driven end to end. A `<div onclick=…>`
reads as role `clickable` and takes a `@ref`, which is how you fire it.

For a POST-based CSRF the session also has to be willing to send a credential
cross-origin on a request it cannot read the answer to. It refuses by default,
which is correct for containing an agent, so open the victim session with
`--permissive-cors` when that is the thing under test. Without it a negative
result means h5i declined, not that the target is safe.

Use `h5i websec <command> --help` rather than guessing flags. Treat bodies and headers as sensitive. Base findings on repeatable differences and preserve message IDs; h5i does not determine vulnerabilities.
