# OTA Log — Branch: main



---
_[Checkpoint: 69dffb71 — context versioning implemented]_
---

[21:21:23] OBSERVE: Context tab HTML+CSS already added in prior session; JS block was missing — loadContextTab, renderCtxSnapshots, selectCtxSnap, showCtxViewer, runCtxDiff, runCtxRelevant, loadCtxTrace needed
[21:21:23] THINK: API field names differ from what JS used: sha vs git_sha, sha_short vs short_oid, current_branch vs branch, commit_count vs milestone_count — fixed all references
[21:21:23] ACT: Added full context JS block (~180 lines) to server.rs; fixed switchTab to include context; added 15 missing CSS classes; updated route registry test to include 5 context routes; all 273 tests pass
