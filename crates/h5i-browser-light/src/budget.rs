//! What one page is allowed to spend before the engine stops answering it.
//!
//! # The gap this fills
//!
//! Every limit this engine had was **per request**: a response size cap, a
//! redirect count, a per-request timeout. None of them bounds a page that makes
//! *many* requests. A script in a loop, each fetch individually well-behaved,
//! could keep an engine busy indefinitely and there was nothing to say stop —
//! the receipts would faithfully record every one of ten thousand requests, and
//! recording a runaway is not the same as bounding it.
//!
//! # Why per navigation, and not per session
//!
//! Because of who is spending. A page fetching in a loop is untrusted code the
//! engine cannot otherwise stop, and that is what a budget is for. The *agent*
//! navigating twenty times is the principal exercising its own authority, and
//! bounding that would be this engine deciding how much work its own operator
//! may ask for. So the counters reset when the agent navigates, and a page gets
//! a fresh allowance because a fresh page is a fresh decision by the agent.
//!
//! A session-wide ceiling on top of this is a coherent thing to want and is not
//! built: nothing has asked for one, and the failure it would prevent —
//! an agent looping on `navigate` — is a failure of the thing driving the
//! engine rather than of a page inside it.
//!
//! # Exceeding is a refusal, not a crash
//!
//! Over budget, the next request is denied and recorded as denied, with
//! `budget-exceeded` as the reason. The page sees a failed fetch, which is a
//! thing pages handle; the agent sees the refusal in the request log and in the
//! snapshot's notes. Nothing is torn down, because a page that spent its
//! allowance has still rendered whatever it managed and that is worth reading.
