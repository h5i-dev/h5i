//! `h5i websec`: the HTTP workbench, as an h5i plugin.
//!
//! Burp Suite is an HTTP workbench for humans. This is one for agents: read what
//! a browser session sent, change a part of it, send it again, and compare the
//! answers. The design is `docs/design/design-websec.md`.
//!
//! This binary holds no privilege of its own. Every verb here runs an `h5i
//! browser` verb in a subprocess, which means a plugin cannot reach a session by
//! any path the CLI does not already offer, and its requests are the engine's
//! fetches: checked by the engine's policy, spent from the engine's budget,
//! written into the engine's receipts. That is the whole reason a plugin is a
//! separate process rather than something loaded into h5i (see `src/cli/
//! plugin.rs`).
//!
//! What it adds over typing the underlying verbs is naming. `req_42` rather than
//! a bare number, one noun for the workbench rather than verbs scattered through
//! `h5i browser`, and defaults chosen for a loop rather than for a person
//! reading a page.
