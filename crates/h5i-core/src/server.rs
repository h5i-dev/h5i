//! The box console: `h5i ui`.
//! One screen for what the CLI answers a box at a time: what is the fleet
//! doing, and what has pressed on a boundary? Built over manifests, the
//! resolved policy, the env event log and [`crate::receipt`].
//! Read-only, structurally. Every route is a `GET`, so there is no mutating
//! handler to guard, no CSRF story, and no way to turn this into a remote
//! control for someone's boxes. A monitoring surface that cannot act is a much
//! smaller thing to get wrong.
//! The old `h5i serve` bound loopback and trusted everyone who could reach it,
//! which on a developer machine is every process and every page. This follows
//! [`crate::view`]'s discipline: loopback only, a per-session token minted at
//! `bind` and held in memory rather than on disk, traded by the page for a
//! `SameSite=Strict` cookie, and foreign origins refused by `Origin` *and*
//! `Sec-Fetch-Site`. The second is not belt-and-braces: `Origin` is absent on a
//! markup-driven GET, and two loopback ports are different origins on the same
//! site, so without it any other local port could `<img src>` this console with
//! its cookie attached.
//! Honesty. The dashboard this replaces had a risk classifier; nothing here
//! invents a score to replace it. [`Signals`] is arithmetic over receipts: red
//! means enforcement fired, amber means a run failed or the page reported
//! errors, grey means the evidence is weak. None is an accusation, and the UI
//! never renders a number the receipts do not hold.
