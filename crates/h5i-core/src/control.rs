//! The browser control lock.
//!
//! Two clients can drive one browser: the agent, through `agent-browser`, and a
//! human, through the viewer's input channel. Neither CDP nor agent-browser
//! arbitrates between them. Both dispatch input, and the result is a mess
//! neither can reason about. So the lock is h5i's, and it copies Neko's
//! semantics (`request` / `take` / `release`) rather than inventing new ones.
//!
//! Three rules the design depends on:
//!
//! * The agent holds control by default. A box exists to let an agent work;
//!   it should not have to ask.
//! * A human takes control, never asks for it. Someone reaching for the
//!   viewer wants the pointer now, and the agent is a program that can wait.
//! * Handing control back invalidates what the agent knew. The human moved
//!   the page, so every `@ref` from the agent's last snapshot may now point at
//!   something else. The agent is told to re-snapshot before its next action,
//!   and acting without one is refused rather than mis-clicked.
//!
//! State lives at `<env>/control.json`, host-owned like the rest of the env
//! directory: the box can read who holds control but cannot grant itself the
//! lock (roadmap 5.4, 5.7).
