//! The shapes h5i writes about an HTTP message: the receipt row ([`record`],
//! counts, exportable) and the stored message ([`message`], bytes and
//! credentials, owner-only), plus what more than one reader does with them
//! ([`ledger`], [`triage`]).
//!
//! Separate from the engine so the plugins can read both without linking one
//! (design-websec.md W21). The writers stay in `h5i-browser`.
