//! Plugins: capabilities that are installed rather than shipped.
//!
//! A plugin is a *separate executable*, discovered by name the way `git` finds
//! its subcommands. `h5i websec …` looks for `h5i-websec`, execs it, and hands
//! over the arguments. Nothing is dynamically loaded.
//!
//! That is a security decision, not a packaging preference. The h5i process is
//! the one that resolves policy, writes the receipt before the bytes move and
//! refuses the fetch when the record cannot be written. Code loaded *into* that
//! process would sit inside the boundary it is supposed to be subject to, and
//! every guarantee in the roadmap would then rest on whatever was installed
//! last. A plugin in its own process is subject to the boundary instead: it
//! reaches a session through the same verbs a person types, so its requests are
//! the engine's fetches, checked by the engine's policy, spent from the engine's
//! budget and written into the engine's receipts.
//!
//! What that buys is narrow and worth stating exactly. It is not a sandbox: a
//! plugin runs with the user's own authority and could open a socket itself.
//! What it cannot do is borrow *h5i's* authority, or make a request that the
//! receipts do not describe.
