//! `h5i`: a disposable, confined development environment for coding agents.

//! The library owns the whole CLI: the top-level `Cli`/`Commands` parse, the

//! and handlers live. `src/main.rs` is a three-line binary over [`run`].
//!
//! It is a library so the clap command tree has a second consumer:
